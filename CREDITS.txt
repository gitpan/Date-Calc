Credits:
--------

Many thanks to Andreas Koenig for his efforts as upload-manager for the
CPAN, his patience, and lots of very good advice and suggestions! Thank
you for doing such a tremendous (and very time-consuming) job!!

Also many thanks to David Jenkins for reviewing the first version of this
README file and the english man page.

Thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi for suggesting the "days_in_month()" function.

Many thanks to Christian <chrisi@vm.akh-wien.ac.at> for reporting the bug
fixed in version 1.4, which showed up on an HP E55 running HP-UX 10.01 and
Perl 5.001m with the c89 Ansi 89 compiler from HP.

Also many thanks to David Thompson <dlt@dewey.csun.edu> for reporting a
problem he encountered concerning the inclusion of the Perl distribution
("Unable to find include file ...") and for suggesting a solution for this
problem. (That's the most pleasant kind of problem report, of course! ;-) )

Many thanks to Tom Limoncelli <tal@plts.org> for raising the question of
how to calculate the 2nd Thursday of a given month and year!

Many thanks to Bart Robinson <lomew@cs.utah.edu> for suggesting the "all"
export option and the "decode_day()" and "decode_month()" functions.

Also many thanks to Ron Savage <Ron.Savage@datacraft.com.au> for suggesting
the incorporation of time calculations into this module. (Sorry that I
didn't include the handling of time zones, which can be taken care of
more easily by adding/subtracting the appropriate time value in an extra,
preliminary step!)

Many thanks to Jonathan Lemon <jlemon@americantv.com> for reporting
the bug (and how to fix it!) concerning arrays as parameters, fixed
in version 2.2!

Many thanks to Tim Zingelman <zingelman@fnal.gov> for reporting the problem
fixed in version 2.3 and for testing an intermediate new version of this
module on his machine!

Many thanks to Jonas Liljegren <jonas@cultcom.se> for posting a subroutine
for calculating easter monday in news:comp.lang.perl.modules and thereby
triggering my writing of the new "Date::CalcLib" module which has been
added in version 3.0 of the "Date::Calc" distribution.

Also many thanks to Claus Tondering <c-t@pip.dknet.dk> for his excellent
web pages and FAQ in news:news.answers about calendars and how to calcu-
late easter sunday.

Thanks to Reinhold Stansich <dynaconsult@netway.at> for posting a list
of christian feast days and their offsets from easter sunday in news:
comp.databases.ms-access and to Tammo Schnieder <schniede@hh.sdm.de>
for sending me his posting.

Many thanks to Max Ruffert <mor@mpa-garching.mpg.de> at the Max Planck
Institute for Astrophysics in Garching for looking up Gauss' Rule for
calculating easter sunday (the algorithm which is implemented in the
"Date::CalcLib" module) for me and dictating it to me over the
phone!

Many thanks to Chris Halverson <cdh@CompleteIS.com> for asking me
"is there a "standard" way to create a calendar similar to the output
of cal(1)?", which gave me the idea to write the function "calendar"
which has been added to the module "DateCalcLib" in version 3.1, and
also for the C code demonstrating how to use the C library "lib_date.c"
stand-alone, because that was what he needed to do as well.

Many thanks to Gunardi Wu <gunardi@starindo.net> for notifying me about
the bug in the "Add_Delta_YMD()" function which was fixed in version 4.1.

Thanks to the several people who notified me about two compiler warnings
concerning incompatible character types in Calc.xs line 857 (added two
casts in version 4.2 to fix this flaw).

Many thanks to Alessio Bragadini <alessio@sevenseas.org> for the patch he
sent in to add Italian as one of the supported languages (version 4.3).

Many thanks to Roland Titze <Roland.Titze@ks.sel.alcatel.de> and
to Andrew Brown <alloneword@dial.pipex.com> for pointing out the
misspelling of "whether" (was: wether) throughout my documentation,
corrected in version 5.0.

Special thanks go to Tim Mueller-Seydlitz <Tim.MuellerSeydlitz@blb.de>
for notifying me about the inability of all string decoding routines
to parse special ISO-Latin-1 characters correctly.

Many thanks to Gisle Aas <gisle@aas.no> for many good suggestions
and his patch for adding support for Norwegian.

Many thanks to Jerker Nilsson <jnn@annons.dn.se> for his patch for
adding Swedish.

Also many thanks to Masanao Izumo <mo@goice.co.jp> for raising the
question of a "Delta_YMD()" function and for sending in patches.

And last but not least many thanks to Slaven Rezic <eserte@cs.tu-berlin.de>,
Tobias Brox <tobiasb@odin.funcom.com> and Matthew Persico <persicom@acedsl.com>
for suggesting date objects with overloaded operators, which were added in
version 5.0.

Many thanks to Tobias Brox <tobiasb@odin.funcom.com> again for the idea
of supplying one set of comparison operators which compare only the date
part, and another set of operators which compare date and time (or fall
back to comparing only the date if both operands lack the time part).

Many thanks to Jens Coldewey <jens_coldewey@acm.org>, Michael Niebler
<mniebler@generali.de> and Charles Lane <lane@duphy4.physics.drexel.edu>
for notifying me about the missing "#include <stdio.h>" statement in
DateCalc.c.

Also many thanks to Frank Dabelstein <frankd@imf.au.dk> for his patch for
adding Danish.

Thanks also go to Steve Tolkin <steve.tolkin@fmr.com> for suggesting that
I should emphasize in the README.txt file that the reading of the INSTALL.txt
file is important, especially if running Perl under Windows. :-)

Many thanks to Martin Vorlaender <martin@radiogaga.harz.de> for notifying
me about the problem with the linker on VMS with identifiers longer than
30 characters, and to Charles Lane <lane@duphy4.physics.drexel.edu> for
sending me a patch!

Many thanks to Jarkko Hietaniemi <jhi@iki.fi> for providing me with the
necessary information to add Finnish (suomi).

Many thanks to Graham Barr <gbarr@pobox.com> for his many good suggestions
regarding how to generalize my original, very limited module (based on
Carp.pm) which skips all packages belonging to the "Date::*" hierarchy
(in order to generate an error message from the perspective of the caller),
into a module that can be given a pattern (i.e., a regular expression) of
package names to be skipped. Also many thanks for his suggestions of a
name for this module and for lots of great code he sent!

Also many many thanks to the innumerable contributors of the lists of
American states and abbreviations and many countries' national holidays:

Many thanks again to Martin Vorlaender <martin@radiogaga.harz.de> for

complaining about identifiers which were longer than 30 characters) and
for his confirmation that now everything works (not counting some
innocuous warnings from xsubpp)!
