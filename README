                     ====================================
                       Package "Date::Calc" Version 4.0
                     ====================================


This package is available for download either from my web site at

                  http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/download/

or from any CPAN (= "Comprehensive Perl Archive Network") mirror server:

                  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/STBEY/

The package consists of a C library (useful for C developers) which is the
core of a Perl (wrapper) module (for easy access to the library from Perl).

The C library is specifically designed so that it can be used stand-alone,
without Perl.

What does it do:
----------------



Important note to C developers:
-------------------------------

Note again that the C library at the core of this module can also be
used stand-alone (i.e., it contains no inter-dependencies whatsoever
with Perl).

The library itself consists of three files: "DateCalc.c", "DateCalc.h"
and "ToolBox.h".

Just compile "DateCalc.c" (which automatically includes "ToolBox.h")
and link the resulting output file "DateCalc.o" with your application,
which in turn should include "ToolBox.h" and "DateCalc.h" (in this order).
